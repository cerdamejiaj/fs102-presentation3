# seke2015-panel-presentation

This repository contains the HTML source code and additional resources for a presentation that I, [Jerfenson.
Cerda Mejia](https://cerdamejiaj.github.io/), gave during my FS102 about Spam emails. Informing my classmates the importance of knowing about spam emails and how to avoid them.


Are you interested in previewing the presentation without having to download the code and resources from the GitHub
site? Well, you can! Please view [ The reasons why Internet piracy is good ?](https://rawgit.com/cerdamejiaj/fs102-presentation3/master/seke2015_panel.html).
